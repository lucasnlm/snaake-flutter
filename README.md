Snaake is a small and very simple clone of the classic snake game from Nokia phones.

## Description

The objective is very simple: eat the colorful dots to make the snake longer and to avoid biting itself or hit the wall.

Controls:
- Swipe your finger horizontally to turn left/right.
- Swipe your finger vertically to turn up/down.
